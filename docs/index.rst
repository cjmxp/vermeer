Welcome to Vermeer Light Tools's documentation!
===============================================

Vermeer Light Tools is an open source 3D graphics rendering package. Vermeer provides a ray tracing core, physically plausible shading and deterministic monte-carlo path tracing all wrapped up into a production renderer.

The philosophy behind Vermeer is 'physical as possible but the artist is in charge'. Pragmatic considerations come before physical realism and any attribute may be pushed or pulled beyond the realms of reality. If it looks right, it IS right.
